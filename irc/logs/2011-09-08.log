<span class="irc-date">[13:06]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-christel- [Global Notice] Hi all, as previously promised today will be the day where the network goes up in flames... I mean, where we carry out some upgrades to the ircd. I'm about to kill off a number of servers and the affected user count is ~8K! Hopefully this won't take long but I suggest you brace for impact..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:49]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-christel- [Global Notice] Hi again, that was pretty painfree and she burnt like a phoenix and arose from the ashes. Installment number two is coming to a screen near you on Monday; this time I'll be upgrading hubbard, roddenberry, asimov, verne, stross and gibson. Thank you for using freenode and have a great day!</span><br />
