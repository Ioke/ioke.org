<span class="irc-date">[19:57]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-Martinp23- [Global Notice] Hi everyone. You may know that we run a separate network for the purpose of testing future ircd versions. If you'd like to help test by checking for consistency between versions (eg, information visibility etc), join testnet.freenode.net port 9002 (ssl: 9003). Talk to us in #freenode-seven on the production network. Thanks, and have a great evening.</span><br />
