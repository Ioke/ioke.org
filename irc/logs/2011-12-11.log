<span class="irc-date">[22:11]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-Martinp23- [Global Notice] Hi everyone. Tonight should be our final night of upgrades of ircd-seven for the time being. The servers affected today are card, asimov, and verne. There'll be large netsplits. If you're on a server which will restart, I'll send you a message in a moment. Enjoy the ride - duration about 30 mins! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:40]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-Martinp23- [Global Notice] Hi everyone. The upgrades are now complete. There was a bit of a hiccup when barjavel needed a kicking to connect to the network, but apart from that everything went well. Thanks for your patience through the upgrades. Keen for the next series? Keep an eye on the blog to get involved with testing future versions and to be aware of maintenance. Thanks for using freenode</span><br />
