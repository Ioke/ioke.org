<span class="irc-date">[18:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;slava&gt; i noticed the .ik init files are named so that the sorted order is the right load order</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[18:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cv&gt; even cooler that it works ;D</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[18:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;slava&gt; oh, i was confused i guess</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;slava&gt; you guys should add some kind of require/provide system</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;melwin&gt; slava: Well - I also thought it was read in sorted order, but it's just named to allow a human to determine order.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[18:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;slava&gt; i also have a minor design suggestion if anyone cares</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;slava&gt; since i did a jvm language in a past life and noticed you guys made a design decision which didn't scale, at least in my project</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;melwin&gt; slava: I suggest you take that with Ola. He's probably around later.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;slava&gt; well, its nothing big, so I'll just throw it out now before I forget</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;slava&gt; in IokeList, for example, you register various methods that are visible from Ioke, using a typical Command pattern</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;slava&gt; and the methods do marshalling and unmarshalling for arguments</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[18:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;slava&gt; this sort of creates boilerplate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;slava&gt; its better to do all ioke -&gt; java calls via reflection and have a 'define primitive' primitive as your only exported primitive from the java side, if that makes sense</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;slava&gt; this has the added advantage that down the road a bytecode compiler could generate direct calls to your methods instead of working with command pattern objects in compiled code</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[18:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cv&gt; slava: so you would have a ioke [] point to ioke.lang.IokeList as a primitive? or straight through to java.util.List?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[18:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;slava&gt; i think ioke already has a very clean implementation.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; or rather, in your earlier comments</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; in theory, you're totally right. the problem is that most of the things that unpackage arguments are doing it in different ways. the Java implemented methods will in the end just be the ones that can't be created in the language itself - which means those that do weird stuff with arguments - or need to work with internal resources in some way</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; once the Java integration is in place, I'm actually thinking about reimplementing the core stuff like List, Dict and Set into Ioke code that wraps a Java implementation from the Ioke side</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; this will make things HUGELY more manageable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; so the current state of the code is basically just the easiest way to start the language, and the code base is still malleable enough for easy change</span><br />
