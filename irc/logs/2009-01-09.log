<span class="irc-date">[13:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; hehe</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; neat</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; hehe</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; ok, that was part number one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; now I just need one of those admin bots too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; you have more tricks up your sleeve?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; sorry?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; regarding the bot?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; just sounded like you doing a magic trick</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; well, I referred to the log bot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; if you look at ioke.org/irc/logs you will see it works</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; yep, I can see it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; real time too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; yeah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; see, it is magic, you just didn't realise it ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;olabini&gt; right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; sorry, it's just my strange english humour</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[23:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; And you.... :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; i just got back in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; after quite a few beers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; now sitting on comfy seat with cat on my belly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Nice... Best time to hack, eh?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; it would be if i was a bit more focussed :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; i'm playing around with the TextMate Bundle</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and it's harder than it should be ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Hehe, always fun to read code written when drunk. Lotsa head scratching usually.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; exactly!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Ah - I stole your keyword lists to use in the GeSHi definition I just created.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Thanks for that. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; well i mostly stole them from ola's emacs major mode anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; what goes around comes around</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; I didn't give you credit for that though... I think I should...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; buy me a beer when you come to Amsterdam :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Haha - I can sure do!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; There... Now all's in order: <a href="http://martin.elwin.com/blog/tag/ioke/">http://martin.elwin.com/blog/tag/ioke/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; haha, thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; have you subscribed to the ioke reddit?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Ioke/">http://www.reddit.com/r/Ioke/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; There... Back...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; No! Gotta get me some of that...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; i'm trying to create one resource with all of the Ioke related posts in it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; reddit seemed an easy choice for such a resource</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; I read most on progreddit, but haven't seen to much Ioke related there...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; This looks nice. A number of posts I haven't read yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; ooh great</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; it's nice to be useful :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; I'm just starting with Ioke - but I like it. Has a nice feel to it, and a nice environment.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; i'm in the same boat</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; i'm new to lispy things too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; How did you come across it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; so i have a lot to learn</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; i'm a ruby guy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; so was following ola's work on JRuby</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; So I gathered... :) Based on your blog and /whois.. :]</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; i'm also deeply fascinated with the concept of expressive programming</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; You know what...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; I personally believe that programmers tend to be too infatuated with code efficiency and speed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; ... too rarely do I hear people say that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; ooh, sounds like we're thought buddies</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; that's nice</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Mmm... You thinking cpu is cheaper than brains?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; actually i've taken my thoughts on a little more than that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; it's not even just about price</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; it's also about culture and communication</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; I agree!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; so to see a programming language shun efficiency and focus on being expressive was like music to my ears</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Hmm.. You looked at arc at all?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't think that efficiency is not important, just not everything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; well i followed Paul Graham's musings on arc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; I know you said you were new to the lispy thing, but still...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; but not being a lisp guy, the syntax seemed particularly terse</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and rather impenetrable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Expressive, you mean? ;P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; well i wasn't able to see that through the symbols</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Joke aside, I have, like you, followed the arc story - but I haven't played with the language.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; the thing is with Ioke, it has enough Rubyisms for me to get a rough feeling for what's going on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and the rest is really starting to make a lot of sense</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; I haven't worked with Ruby too much, so I don't really have that to compare it to.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; I just find the message chaining very intuitive.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; Ruby is a wonderful language, particular from a philosophical perspective</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; it has the concept of fun baked into the design goals</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and it has rather a lot of lovely things about it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; You worked with JRuby as well as MRI?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; it has a lovely relaxed syntax</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; lots of literals</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; It's obviously great for internal DSLs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; a decent object model (compared to Java at least)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and yep, it's great for internal DSLs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; I have played with JRuby a little</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; the Java integration is nice</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and being able to manipulate Java objects in a REPL is a joy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; I'm... how should I put it... "forced" to use Java for work. So all languages more powerful than Java on the JVM are of specific interest to me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; well JRuby is a pretty decent choice at the moment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and the Ruby library ecosystem is improving a lot at the moment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; I really like the idea of having a higher level, more expressive language, on top to control lower level (preferable standard) libraries.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; I'm also interested in Clojure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Me too. And Scala.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; Scala looks wacky :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; cool though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; implicit type conversions make my brain hurt</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; I've used Scala the most. It's got close to perfect Java integration (if compared to the other alternatives).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; i just like the idea of choosing the right language for the task in hand</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; So the impedance mismatch is less I find.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Yes - again I completely agree.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and so the JVM seems like a great platform to invest in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; As lots of people have said before - it really grinds my gears when I meet consultants or whatever who say they are "Java programmers", or "C# programmers", etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; it may not be perfect, but it's already a healthy breeding ground for interesting new languages</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; I guess I'd say I'm a Ruby programmer, but I'm really trying to change that ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; No offense intended...!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; although I guess I'd try to emphasise that I'm not just interested in programming</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; But you seem to have the right attitude, though... :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; I'm also fascinated by language</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; As in human languages?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; some languages are more equal than others</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; well, language in general</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; What, may I ask, is the subject of your PhD?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; it was originally Interest Management within Virtual Environments</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Umm... Ok... Interest Management? Care to elaborate?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; ok, virtual environments as they were (and mostly are today) are just  computing systems with a lot of participants creating events</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; the american military pumped a whole lot of money into building such systems to run war simulations</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; in order to train soldiers etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; they rapidly hit a bottleneck with the systems they were trying to create</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Aha... I see where you're going...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; i.e. as the number of participants increased, the number of events per unit of time increased quadratically</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and events mean messages</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; So, Interest Management - distribute/partition content of environment based on what is relevant to each participant... Or similar...?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Right, I see.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; pretty much</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Sounds interesting...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; basically, don't send all events to each user, just send the interesting ones</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Right.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and a whole load of different techniques have been created for this purpose</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; my issue with this was that each of these techniques were created in isolation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; so i set out to survey them and describe them all in terms of set theory</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Several years ago I was looking at improving the network code of a combat flight sim to increase scalability... I should have talked to you about that...! :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; I see.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; sure :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Did you do any implementations as well?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; yeah, a bullshit one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; In ruby? :]</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; well...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; I converted the set theory to SQL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; which was pretty simple</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and i was doing all this with Java</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Ok... Was this for an existing application/system?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; but my Java skills aren't too great</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; (no it was all a hocus pocus academic throw-away prototype thing)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and I was finding that my Java skills were holding my ideas back</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Aha.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; i.e. the rate of coding couldn't match the rate of ideas</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; so I learned Ruby</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and reimplimented everything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and it was such an improvement ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; life was good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Hehe - still with SQL against a DB, I guess?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and then I built a DSL to describe the interests in a language that was as similarly complex as the concepts the language was representing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; which was certainly not the case with the SQL equivalent</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; oh and yeah, still with SQL against a DB</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; but it wasn't really the implementation that was my research</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Ah, right.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; more the formalisation of the interest management techniques</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; You done with it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; that's the beauty of academia - you don't actually have to build anything decent ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; yeah, I submitted in August 2007</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; passed my Viva in December</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Hehe... So now reality has hit you like a brick wall, eh?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and graduated early 2008</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; haha</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; of course!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Found something decent to do?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; well I work for a lovely company in Amsterdam</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; doing Rails work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; which is pretty decent</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; we also did some client work last year in which I got to elaborate on my DSL ideas</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Get to use the m4d PhD sk1llz at all?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; which worked out super well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Oh, nice.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; yeah it was remarkable really</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; That's always fun - really getting to use one's experience.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; the client could actually read the code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and was super happy with what was going on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Anything released as OSS?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; you could tell that after he had read the code he had complete faith in what we were doing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; no, it was really bespoke stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; not sure what generic stuff I could have extracted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Mmm... You read Fowler's recent on DSLs?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; loudmouth fowler</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; he wears leather trousers you know</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; but writes really nicely :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; it's a shame he feels the pressure to write it all in terms of Java though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Leather? That he might do. But he also said that while business people might not write the business DSL code, it can sure help when communicating. And I agree with this.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; yeah, well that was exactly my experience</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; I sure as hell wasn't going to let the client write the code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; I've already been burned with that before</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; whilst working on my Ph.D. I did some research implementation for another dept</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; in which (again) I built a DSL, this time to represent a complicated questionnaire</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; the client seemed super keen to start editing the DSL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and for the most part it was great</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; but when he messed up, it took *ages* to work out what he had done</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and it caused all sorts of versioning issues too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Yeah... Hehe.. Pretty much reflects exactly what Fowler also said.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; I see the DSL purely as a communication mechanism</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Pretty sharp cookie, for wearing lederhosen.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; a model of some part of the system that both parties can understand</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; You heard of BPEL?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; nope</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Let me enlighten you (you're going to wish you weren't).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; Business Process Execution Language</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; sounds like a nightmare</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Business Process Execution Language. It's an XML standard.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Well... There you go.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; oh, and XML too!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; oh goodie!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; I mean, XML is totally readable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; It's an XML standard for describing an executable business process at the web service orchestration level.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; &lt;everyone&gt;likes&lt;/talking&gt;&lt;/in&gt;&lt;/tags&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; It's meant - like all XML originally were - to be created and edited using graphical tools.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; And, as the name implies, it was originally aimed at more business level people.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; The GUI tool sort of looks like a workflow in Visio.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; i'm still unsure about generic tools at this stage</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Which looks nice and all.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; But imaging putting it in the hands of a non developer.... To do webservice invocations and transformations etc...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; hahahaha</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; It's a non starter.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; BUT.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; just like giving the project to a MS gold certified team</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; It can be used as a graphical DSL to describe service/message orchestration. And properly used it also has a nice place when communicating with less technical people.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; cool</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; MS Gold? Ooooh... Shiny...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; i worked with some gold boys last year</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; they were generating a big steaming pile of XML for me to parse (with my lovely DSL generated streaming parser)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; one day I noticed a whole bunch of my tests were failing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; So - my point - again a DSL can be really nice to do higher level descriptions of more business related concerns. But it's quite a big step until a non techie can work with it themselves.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; it turned out that they had switched half of the XML to UTF-16 from UTF-8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Hehe... Non compliant XML parser? ;P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; what was scary was that they didn't realise they had done this</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Ahh... Yes...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and what was even scarier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Those kind of mistakes always gives me the shivers.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; was when we asked them to give us one or the other, they just said...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; "can't you just replace the 8 with a 16 at the start of the files?"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; Gold Certified!!!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Note to self: ask for platinum next time. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; hehe</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; just don't trust certifications</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; Amen to that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; whatever material they're made of</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; I'm sure that there must exist a few good developers at their company</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Melwin&gt; I work in the consulting business myself - and it's scary how easy it is to exceed customer's expectations.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; but not all the people they hire out for consultancy come with the same calibre</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; haha yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; these guys also built a webservice with absolutely no concurrency</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;naeu&gt; and with blocking reads</span><br />
