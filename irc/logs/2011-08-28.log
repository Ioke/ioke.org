<span class="irc-date">[10:35]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-Martinp23- [Global Notice] Hi folks. In preparation for some maintenance, we need to do a bit of re-hubbing. This is going to basically involve nearly all of EU splitting from US - so it's going to be noisy. Sorry for the inconvenience, and I'll send another message when we're done.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:49]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-Martinp23- [Global Notice] Hi everyone - that's the end of the ride. Everything that needs to be is now re-hubbed, so thanks for your patience and for using freenode, and sorry for the noise. Ask in #freenode with questions. :)</span><br />
