<span class="irc-date">[13:38]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-Martinp23- [Global Notice] Hi everyone. It's time for further ircd upgrades to take place (see blog.freenode.net for details). The servers affected today are pratchett, calvino, leguin and niven. One of our US hubs will also be restarted, so there will be a very large netsplit. Please fasten your seatbelts. I'll send messages directly to affected users and will let you know when it's all done. Thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:09]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-Martinp23- [Global Notice] Wheeeeee. The main part of this week's upgrades is done. Thanks for your patience and I hope you enjoyed the ride... Our last round of ircd upgrades is next week, so don't miss the fun :)</span><br />
