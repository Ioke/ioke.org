<span class="irc-date">[13:18]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-Martinp23- [Global Notice] Hi folks. Over the next 30 mins or so I'll be doing some network upgrades. This will be in two stages. First, there will be a huge netsplit, followed by smaller netsplits. About 2700 users will lose connections as a result. I'll send messages directly to users on servers which will be restarted in a moment (zelazny, kornbluth). Thanks for your patience and have a great sunday.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:06]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-Martinp23- [Global Notice] Hi - today's updates are now complete. Join us next week for the next game of upgrades roulette (see blog for schedule if you want to ruin the surprise). Have a great day! :)</span><br />
